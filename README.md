# Real Time Web Application
This application gets the windspeed in real-time and calculates what sailsize you need to rig.  
Concept inspired by [this project](https://github.com/RoryMearns/Windsurf_Calculator)

It uses the (private) winfdinder api to get the current report for a spot. To use this api I'm using my own [wind-scrape](https://github.com/jeroentvb/wind-scrape) package.
